## Wrapping up the 2023 edition

Firstly we need to say a massive thank you to the community and the subject matter experts that helped put together the 2023 edition of #90DaysOfDevOps

I really appreciate the effort that was put into this years project, the aim for the year was to raise awareness of security when it comes to DevSecOps and also then to continue the DevOps journey through some of the areas that ee could not cover in 2022. 

I also appreciate the community at large that have translated and fixed issues throughout the 2022 and 2023 edition. 

The whole premise of this project started with just me taking notes which then seemingly helped a lot of people with a structured approach to learning the concept of DevOps and DevSecOps. The project provides a big picture, some theory and tooling options available, with a conclusion of getting hands on and walking through a pin pointed scenario. 

All of this is great but I want to take a look at some of the areas throughout the project, then I would like to take a view on the project health overall finishing up on what's next.
